// second way
/* 

store individual lecture into LectureCollection
        {
            lid: 1
            subject: "Machine Learning",
            teacher: "Sunita",
            startTime: 9,
            endTime: 10,
        },
        {
            lid: 2
            subject: "Machine Learning",
            teacher: "Sunita",
            startTime: 10,
            endTime: 11,
        },


and then seperately store a list of id for the lecture for a date then store it into different dateCollection
        {
            id: 1
            date = 1-1-2024
            lectures = [1,2],
        }
        {
            id: 2
            date = 2-1-2024
            lectures = [1,2],
        }
        {
            id: 3
            date = 2-1-2024
            lectures = [4,5],
        }
        

and then seperately store a list of id of daySchedule and use that for batch in batchCollection
        {
            batch: 'tysd',
            daySchedules: [1,2,]
        }
        {
            batch: 'tyit',
            daySchedules: [3,]
        }


so when i want to get the timetable for today
I will query to batchCollection to get the list of daySchedule that belongs to my batch collection || this won't work cause firebase 
then i will query to dayCollection for each id of daycollection and check if their date matches with today and get the lecture id
then i will query to LectureCollection for each id of lectures and store all the lecture data


// third way

        {
            lid: 1
            batch: tysd,
            date: 1-1-2024
            subject: "Machine Learning",
            teacher: "Sunita",
            startTime: 9,
            endTime: 10,
        },
        {
            lid: 2
            batch: tysd,
            date: 1-1-2024
            subject: "something else",
            teacher: "someone",
            startTime: 10,
            endTime: 9,
        },
        {
            lid: 3
            batch: tyit,
            date: 1-1-2024
            subject: "something else",
            teacher: "someone",
            startTime: 9,
            endTime: 10,
        },



in this case if i want todays timetable then
I will query LectureCollection for all the docs where batch matches 'tysd' then date matches '1-1-2024'

in this case if want to check if the slot is free
I will query lectureCollection for 30000 docs where 
    batch is tysd and date is 1-1-2024 
    and Start time is less than or equal to 9 
    and end time is greater than 10
and then do this for all 4 lecture for 6 batch, so 24 times querying and matching through 30000 document

// Fourth way : Final

    tysd-1-1-2024: {
        {
            lid: 1
            batch: tysd,

            startTime: 9,

        {
            lid: 2

        },
        {

            teacher: "fatima",
            startTime: 9,
            endTime: 10,
        },

Teacher timetable:
    teacher-1-1-2024:{
        {
            startTime: 9,
            endTime:10
        }
    }

Lecture days = 9(months) * 24(dates) = 216
dayDoc for all batch in a year= 216 * 6 = 1296

lecture per day = 4
Case 4: Create a weekly timetable for tysd
get the lsit of sub for tysd (mm,da,ra,ML,cc,ot,bd, proj)
how will i get list of sub for each batch


store freq of each subject + topple up remaining freq
for day in week:
    check if tt exist for day: if no then
    create tt for day 
    for each sub, check if sub Teacher available:
        check if subFreq[sub]>0
        retrieve teacher timeatable for that day 
        check if st+duration > dayEnd: if true then exit(next day)
        check for each element where starttime <= st && endtime > et:if true
            tt.day.add({
                lid: 1
                batch: tysd,
                subject: "sub",
                teacher: "subTeacher",
                startTime: st,
                endTime: st+duration,
            }) 
            subFreq[sub]--;
check if subFreq for all sub is 0: if false then add to next week
        
        


Case 4: get timetable for today
query through 1296 dayDoc and get doc where day is today and batch is tysd

case 4: Check if the slot is free
get todays timetable for tysd and go through lectures(4) where 
    and Start time is less than or equal to 9 
    and end time is greater than 10 



/*
worries
1. how will it handle custom time like 9:45 instead of 10 or 9:10? will have to work on slots
one solution for this could be storing start and end timing and using that to compare with other event timings to check if free time is available

Lecture stats:
lecture per day 4
lectures per week = 4*6 = 24
lectures per month(23 days) = 23*24 = 552
lectures per year (9 month) =552*9 = 4698
lectures per year for all batch(6) = 6*4698= 28188

roundoff = 30000 lectures per year
